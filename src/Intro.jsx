      <h3>GUIDELINES FOR SELECTING STREET NAMES</h3>
      <strong>Submitting this application does not mean all of the streets will be approved.  City and County staff will further review the streets and reach out if more streets are needed or if changes need to be made.</strong>
      <br/>
      <p>
        City and County staff will determine whether the names submitted in this
        application are acceptable. Please consider the following guidelines
        when selecting your possible road names:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>An Individual person's name is not allowed</li>
        <li>
          Directionals and numbers are not allowed e.g. North Star Ln; Four
          Corners Dr
        </li>
        <li>
          Punctuation is not allowed e.g. periods, hyphens, apostrophes
        </li>
        <li>All names must have an acceptable type e.g. Road, Lane, Path</li>
        <li>Double street types are not allowed: e.g. Deer Path Lane</li>
        <li>
          Names must be easy to pronounce and should effect a positive
          connotation
        </li>
        <li>
          Names duplicating or sounding similar to existing names will be
          rejected.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>
              note: this is only the street name, not the street type. For
              example, if a Main St exists, Main Dr is considered a duplicate.

          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
